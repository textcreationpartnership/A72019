            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Iewes &amp; Ethnicks derided both the Apo≈øtles, and the re≈øt of the Chri≈øtians for preaching and beleeuing in him who was crucified vpon the Cro≈ø≈øe: yet all both Apo≈øtles and Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were ≈øo farre from beeing di≈øcouraged from their profe≈øsion by the ignominie of the Cro≈ø≈øe, as they rather reioyced and triumphed in it. Yea, the holy Gho≈øt by the mouthes of the Apo≈øtles did honour the Name of the Cro≈ø≈øe (being hatefull among the Iewes) ≈øo farre, that vnder it, he comprehended not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chri≈øt crucified, but the force, effects, and merits of his Death and Pa≈øsion, with all the comforts, fruits, and promi≈øes which wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue or expect thereby.</p>
                  <p>Secondlly, the honour and dignitie of the Name of the Cro≈ø≈øe, begat a reuerend e≈øtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion euen in the Apo≈øtles times (for ought that is knowen to the contrary) of the ≈øigne of the Cro≈ø≈øe: which the Chri≈øtians ≈øhortly after v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed in all their actions, thereby making an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ≈øhew &amp; profe≈øsion euen to the a≈øtoni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Iewes, that they were not a≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to acknowledge him for their Lord and Sauiour, who died for them vpon the Cro≈ø≈øe.
<pb facs="tcp:152063:52"/>
And this ≈øigne they did not onely v≈øe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues with a kinde of glory, when they met with any Iewes, but ≈øigned therewith their children when they were Chri≈øtned, to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them by that badge to his ≈øeruice, who≈øe benefits be≈øtowed vpon them in Bapti≈øme, the name of the Cro≈ø≈øe did repre≈øent. And this v≈øe of the ≈øigne of the Cro≈ø≈øe in Bapti≈øme was held in the Primitiue Church, as well by the Greekes as the Latines, with one con≈øent and great applau≈øe. At what time, if any had oppo≈øed them≈øelues again≈øt it, they would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely haue beene cen≈øured as enemies of the name of the Cro≈ø≈øe, &amp; con≈øequently of Chri≈øts merits, the ≈øigne whereof they could no better endure. This continuall and generall v≈øe of the ≈øigne of the Cro≈ø≈øe, is euident by many te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtimonies of the ancient Fathers.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it mu≈øt be confe≈ø≈øed that in proce≈ø≈øe of time, the ≈øigne of the Cro≈ø≈øe was greatly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u≈øed in the Church of Rome, e≈øpecially after that corruption of Popery had once po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed it But the abu≈øe of a thing doth not take away the lawfull v≈øe of it.

and reiect the Churches of Italie, France, Spaine, Germany, or any ≈øuch like Churches in all things which they helde and practi≈øed, that, as the Apologie of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land confe≈ø≈øeth, it doth with reuerence retaine tho≈øe Ceremonies which doe neither endam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage the Church of God, nor offende the minds of ≈øober men: and onely departed from them in tho≈øe particular points, wherein they were fallen both from them≈øelues in their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent integritie, &amp; from the Apo≈øtolicall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which were their fir≈øt founders. In which re≈øpect, among≈øt ≈øome other very ancient Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, the ≈øigne of the Cro≈ø≈øe in Bapti≈øme hath bene retained in this Church both by the iudgement and practi≈øe of tho≈øe reuerend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and great Diuines in the dayes of King Edward the ≈øixth, of whom ≈øome con≈øtantly ≈øuffered for the profe≈øsion of the trueth: and others being exiled in the time of Queene Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, did after their returne in the beginning of the Reigne of our late dread Soueraigne, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually defend and v≈øe the ≈øame. This re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and practi≈øe of our Church hath beene allowed and approoued by the cen≈øure vpon
<pb facs="tcp:152063:54"/>
the Communion Booke in King Edward the ≈øixt his dayes, and by the harmonie of confe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions of latter yeeres: becau≈øe in deede the v≈øe of this ≈øigne in Bapti≈øme was euer accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied here with ≈øuch ≈øufficient cautions and exceptions again≈øt all Popi≈øh Super≈øtition and errour, as in the like ca≈øes are either fit or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient.</p>
                  <p>Fir≈øt, the Church of England ≈øince the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhing of Poperie hath euer held and taught, and ≈øo doth hold and teach ≈øtill, that the ≈øigne of the Cro≈ø≈øe v≈øed in Bapti≈øme, is no part of the ≈øub≈øtance of that Sacrament. For when the Mini≈øter dipping the Infant in Water, or lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Water vpon the face of it (as the maner al≈øo is) hath pronounced the≈øe wordes, <hi>I bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize thee in the Name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost,</hi> the Infant is fully and perfectly baptized. So as the ≈øigne of the Cro≈ø≈øe being afterwards v≈øed, doeth neither adde any thing to the vertue or perfection of Bapti≈øme, nor being omitted doeth detract a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing from the effect and ≈øub≈øtance of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is apparant in the Communion Booke, that the Infant baptized is by vertue of

Bapti≈øme, before it be ≈øigned with the ≈øigne of the Cro≈ø≈øe, receiued into the Congregation of Chri≈øts flocke as a perfect member thereof, and not by any power a≈øcribed vnto the ≈øigne of the Cro≈ø≈øe So that for the very remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Cro≈ø≈øe, which is very precious to all them that rightly beleeue in <hi>Ie≈øu Chri≈øt,</hi> and in the other re≈øpects mentioned, the Church of England hath reteined ≈øtill the ≈øigne of it in Bapti≈øme: following therein the Primitiue and Apo≈øtolicall Churches, &amp; accounting it a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful outward Ceremony &amp; honourable Badge, whereby the Infant is dedicated to the ≈øeruice of him that died vpon the Cro≈ø≈øe, as by the words v≈øed in the Booke of Common prayer it may appeare.</p>
                  <p>La≈øtly, the v≈øe of the ≈øigne of the Cro≈ø≈øe in Bapti≈øme, beeing thus purged from all Popi≈øh ≈øuper≈øtition and errour, and reduced in the Church of England to the primary In≈øtitution of it vpon tho≈øe true rules of Doctrine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning things indifferent, which are con≈øonant to the word of God, and the iudgements of all the ancient Fathers: Wee hold it the part of euery priuate man, both Mini≈øter and other,
